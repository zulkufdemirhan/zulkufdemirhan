I’m a Product Designer & UX Engineer with hands-on experience delivering end-to-end product design across complex, cross-functional teams. I work from problem discovery to delivery, owning the full design lifecycle while aligning user needs, business goals, and technical constraints.

I actively contribute throughout the product development process from user research and ideation to prototyping, validation, handoff, iteration, and testing collaborating closely with Product Managers, Engineers, and stakeholders using agile workflows to ensure clarity, alignment, and impact.

## 🔎 What I do
- Lead end-to-end product design across discovery, validation and delivery
- Run user research, interviews, and usability testing to inform decisions
- Design user flows, information architecture, wireframes, high-fidelity UI and interactive prototypes
- Build and evolve design systems and component libraries (Storybook, Lookbook)
- Provide detailed handoffs, implementation support, and validation during delivery
- Work cross-functionally in Agile / Scrum environments to ship impactful outcomes

## 🧭 Design & Collaboration
- Discovery & Problem Definition
- User Research, Interviews & Usability Testing
- User Flows & Information Architecture
- Wireframes → High-Fidelity UI → Interactive Prototypes
- Design Systems, Component Libraries, Storybook
- Design Handoff, Implementation Support & QA
- Agile / Sprint-based collaboration with PMs and Engineers

## 🛠 Tools & Technical Background
- Design & Prototyping: Figma, FigJam, Canva, Lookbook, Storybook
- Productivity & Automation: Make, Cursor, Stitch, Lovable, Bolt AI

- Web / Front-end basics: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript
- Versioning & workflows: Git
- Experience in Ruby on Rails environments
- Exploring AI-powered design & dev tools to accelerate research and prototyping

## 💡 Approach
I take a holistic, outcome-driven approach: solutions must be user-centered, technically feasible, and built for real-world scale. I prioritize clarity in research, measurable goals, rapid prototyping, and close engineering collaboration to ensure high-quality delivery.
